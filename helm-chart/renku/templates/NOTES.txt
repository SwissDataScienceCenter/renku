The RENKU platform has been deployed to your cluster.

If all things were set up correctly, you will soon be able to access it at:
{{ template "http" . }}://{{ .Values.global.renku.domain }}/

{{ if .Values.keycloak.createDemoUser -}}
You have configured a demo user for the platform. The details (password) of this user
can be accessed using the following one-liner (you need to have jq installed).
kubectl get secrets -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ template "renku.fullname" . }} -o json | jq -r .data.users | base64 --decode
{{- end -}}

{{ if .Values.ui.privacy.enabled -}}
You may need to customize privacy values for your RenkuLab deployment (E.G. the Privacy page).
Please refer to the following documentation: https://renku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/index.html#additional-configurations
