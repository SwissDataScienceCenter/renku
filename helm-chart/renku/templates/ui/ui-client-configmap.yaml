    # Privacy statement
    The content of this page is only a template.
    ## Information
    If you are reading this message, the Privacy page content has not been updated for this RenkuLab deployment.
    The following content is intended to be read by a RenkuLab admin.
    ## Configure the Privacy Page
    You should customize the privacy statement by cloning the sample ConfigMap ``*-sample-privacy`` and adjust the
    content. Any markdown formatted text works. Feel free to change the ConfigMap key and to pick any name,
    be sure to properly configure the values ``ui.privacy.page`` before upgrading your RenkuLab deployment.
    If the mapping is enabled but no text is provided (empty content, wrong ``privacy.page`` values, missing
    ConfigMap, etc.), the links in the navigation bars will be hidden and users manually accessing the privacy page
    will get a warning.
    Consider changing the cookie banner content as well when the privacy page is not available.
    ## Apply the changes
    If you edit the ConfigMap content and you don't upgrade the deployment from helm, keep in mind that the
    ui pod needs to be manually re-deployed in order to apply the changes to the privacy page.
