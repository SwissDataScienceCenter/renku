          Hello Renku team,

          I would like access to more compute resources on RenkuLab. Here is some information about me and my project:

          I am affiliated with an educational institution: (yes or no)
          If yes: <enter here>

          The amount of resources I need for my project is:
          <enter here> CPU
          <enter here> RAM
          <enter here> GPU

          Please send us the link to your project(s) on RenkuLab:
          <enter here>
