0.57.0
------

Renku `0.57.0` brings a suite of new features and improvements to the Renku 2.0 beta. As a main
highlight, you can now save and reuse the credentials for data sources. No more copy/paste on every
session launch! We have also made small improvements to sharing, search, and sessions in Renku 2.0.
For a full list of changes, see the list below. 


NOTE to administrators: Upgrading the `csi-rclone` component will unmount all cloud storage for all
active or hibernated sessions. Therefore, we recommend notifying your users ahead of time when you
deploy this version of Renku and also if possible deploying the upgrade when there are fewer
sessions that use cloud storage or just fewer sessions in general. Once the upgrade is complete
users will be able to mount cloud storage as usual.

- `renku-data-services 0.14.0 <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-data-services/releases/tag/v0.14.0>`_

0.52.1
------

Renku ``0.52.1`` fixes a few bugs in Renku 2.0, namely cases where:
- sessions could not start if the parent project listed zero repositories and one or more cloud storages to mount
- long running data migrations for user namespaces would cause the data service to keep restarting and never start

This release also includes minor improvements on the backend that will not be visible to users.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release changes the name of the background jobs that synchronize
the data service with Keycloak and also changes the corresponding section for these jobs in the values file.
These jobs have a more general name because they will perform data migrations for the data service in addition to
synchronizing with Keycloak. This requires additional actions from administrators only if you are setting custom
values for ``dataService.keycloakSync`` in the values file, but in most cases the default images set in this
section will be used so no action will be required.


User-Facing Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**üêû Bug Fixes**

- **Notebooks**: Do not add storage mounts patches when a session has no repository (`#1892 <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-notebooks/pull/1892>`_)

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**üåü New Features**

- **Data service**: Remove leading underscores on route names
- **Data service**: Do not crash when a user that is already in a resource pool is added again to the same pool

0.52.0
------

Renku ``0.52.0`` introduces a new feature to save and use secrets in RenkuLab sessions.
For example, save your credentials for a database or external computing resource in
RenkuLab to access those external systems from a RenkuLab session. Save secrets via the
new User Secrets page in the account drop down, and choose which secrets to mount in a
session on the Start with Options page. More details on this feature can be found in the
[documentation](https://renku.readthedocs.io/en/stable/topic-guides/secrets/secrets.html).

Administrators can customize the culling times (the length of time before an idle session is paused
or a paused session is deleted) for different resource pools.

This release also contains new features related to Renku 2.0. However, Renku 2.0 is still
in early development and is not yet accessible to users. For more information, see our
[blog](https://blog.renkulab.io/renku-2).

0.51.1
------

Renku ``0.51.1`` fixes a bug where sessions were not considering the case (upper or lower) of the
project name that was being cloned when a session is started. This resulted in the working directory
being set to one location and the project cloned in another. This bug only affected projects where
users have manually changed their project paths to include uppercase characters or for projects that
were not created through Renku but were imported after creation.

0.47.1
------

This release only includes changes to the documentation and updates to the acceptance tests.
It doesn't bring any new features or bug fixes.


0.47.0
------

This release expands Renku's cloud storage functionality in two key ways: First, mounted storages
are now read **and write**, so you can use mounted storage as an active workspace for your data in a RenkuLab
session. Second, we have expanded the cloud storage services you can integrate with RenkuLab. You can now
mount not only S3 buckets, but also WebDAV-based storages and Azure Blobs.

If you use SSH sessions via the CLI, you can use cloud storage there too! Configure cloud storage for your
project on RenkuLab.io, and those storages will be mounted in your remote session. Support for cloud
storage in local Renku sessions is still on our roadmap.

This release also adds the ability to change which resource class your session uses when you unpause the
session, in case the original resource class is now full.

0.42.1
------

Renku ``0.42.1`` is a bugfix release that addresses the following bugs in a few services:

- creating new resources in the ``data-services`` API
- properly enforcing access controls to the default resource pool
- accidentally removing the git repository directory from hibernated sessions
- properly templating node affinities and tolerations from the ``data-services`` into user sessions

0.42.0
------

Renku ``0.42.0`` allows RenkuLab administrators to easily manage user resource pools via an Admin Panel built into RenkuLab.
User resource pools are a way to manage the compute resources accessible to groups of RenkuLab users for interactive sessions.
From the new Admin Panel, admins can create resource pools, set their max resource quotas, customize the session classes
available within pools, and add users to pools. Admins can access the new Admin Panel by navigating to the account icon
in the top right in RenkuLab and selecting 'Admin Panel'. To access the Admin Panel, a user must have the `renku-admin` role
delegated to them in Keycloak.

In addition, the login screen was updated to better space components on smaller screens and fix minor
visual glitches.

0.41.0
------

Renku ``0.41.0`` adds new functionality for configuring external storage in projects! Users can now
configure external storage to be mounted automatically in their sessions. The settings are persisted for the project,
but access control is managed by the provider of the storage, not by Renku. This means that for restricted
data sources, users must enter credentials separately. This first implementation only supports S3-compatible storage,
but we will add support for additional providers soon.

Lastly, with this release administrators can configure the RenkuLab homepage to highlight chosen projects.

**A note to Renku administrators**: this release includes breaking changes in our Helm chart values file.
Refer to the ``Internal Changes`` section below for more details.

User-Facing Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**üåü New Features**

- üñº **UI**: Admins can designate projects to be showcased on the home page, which will show them

  to customize to support external S3 and S3 compatible storage better
  (`#2760 <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-ui/pull/2760>`_).
- üåà **UI**: Improve color contrast and other UX elements
  (`#2846 <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-ui/pull/2846>`_).

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release is a breaking change to the Helm values file and it requires minor edits to the following field:

- ``ui.homepage`` removed the unused ``projects`` field and added the ``showcase`` field.
- ``amalthea.scheduler.*`` deprecates all existing child fields and adds new child fields. If you are not defining these fields
  in your values file then you are using the default Kubernetes scheduler and this requires no action. But if you are
  defining a custom scheduler in your deployment's values file then this requires additional edits to your values file
  so that you can retain the same functionality as before.
- the ``crc`` field in the values file has been renamed to ``dataService``, all child fields remain the same
  functionally and by name.

For more details on the Helm chart values changes please refer to the explanation in ``helm-chart/values.yaml.changelog.md``.

In addition to this, other notable changes include:

- add node affinities and tolerations for resource classes
- persist cloud storage configurations at the project level
- validation of Rclone cloud storage configuration by the backend
- update the Amalthea scheduler to work with newer versions of Kubernetes
- ``renku-notebooks`` now get S3 cloud storage configuration from ``renku-data-services``
- ``renku-gateway`` now provides credentials for the cloud storage potion of ``renku-data-services``
- UI shows prominent banners during major outages
- various bug fixes across many components
- users can be prevented from accessing the default resource pool in ``renku-data-services``

Individual components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `renku-notebooks 1.19.1 <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-notebooks/releases/tag/1.19.1>`_

0.39.1
------

Renku ``0.39.1`` fixes bugs in the Helm chart introduced by ``0.39.0``.


Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This introduces changes in the templates and values file of the Helm chart from 0.39.0 that were causing the Helm upgrade
operation to fail.

0.39.0
------

Renku ``0.39.0`` moves all renku component Helm charts to one single chart that now resides in this repository.

After initial testing we have noticed a bug in this version of the Helm chart. If you have already deployed this version simply
upgrading to ``0.39.1`` will fix things. If you have not yet deployed this version then skip it and go straight to ``0.39.1``.
The reason for the bug is that we replaced the ``spec.selector.matchLabels`` field of two important deployments in the Gateway
because of this the two components do not upgrade and the whole Helm upgrade operation fails.

Also, with the next releases we will adopt a specific way of versioning the helm chart. Namely:

- Patch changes (i.e. ``0.50.1`` -> ``0.50.2``) indicate that there are NO changes in the Helm chart and that
  only application level bug fixes are present in the new release.
- Minor version changes (i.e. ``0.50.2`` -> ``0.51.0``) indicate that there are NO changes in the Helm chart and that
  only application level new features and/or application level breaking changes are present.
- Major version changes (i.e. ``0.50.0`` -> ``1.0.0``) will be reserved for changes in the Helm chart, either when the
  values file changes or when the Helm templates change.

Please note that this is a breaking change to the values file and it requires three minor edits to the following fields:

- ``graph.jena.*`` moved to ``jena.*``
- ``notebooks.amalthea.*`` moved to ``amalthea.*``
- ``notebooks.dlf-chart.*`` moved to ``dlf-chart.*``

For more details please refer to the explanation in ``helm-chart/values.yaml.changelog.md``.

Internal Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are now no more separate Helm charts for the core, notebooks, graph, UI and gateway components. All the Helm
templates have been moved into the main Renku Helm chart in this repository.

0.38.0

0.37.0
------

Renku ``0.37.0`` introduces a new feature to pause sessions and later resume them exactly where you left off. All of your work in progress, including files, data, and environment changes not saved to git, are resumed right as you left them.

This feature replaces RenkuLab's branch-based auto-save mechanism. Most users do not have to do anything to transition from auto-saves to persistent sessions. However, if your last session went into an auto-save, you can still retrieve that work by using Start with Options and selecting your most recent auto-save branch. If your project contains auto-save branches that you do not need anymore, you can safely delete them.

- `renku-graph 2.37.0 <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-graph/releases/tag/2.37.0>`_


0.31.0
------

Renku ``0.31.0`` introduces the compute resource control (CRC) service, enabling
Renku administrators to manage access to specific computing resources. The
service exposes an HTTP API for the administrators to interact with. In this
way, Renku administrators can create, update or delete resource pools, and can
add to or remove users from resource pools. Please note that a user interface
for the CRC has not been added yet but it will be added in a future release.
Currently, the only way for administrators to interact with the CRC service is
through the swagger page which can be found at the path
``/swagger/?urls.primaryName=crc%20service`` appended to the base URL of a Renku
deployment. A Renku administrator is any user who has the `renku-admin` realm
role. Assigning users to this role can be performed by the Keycloak
administrator via the Keycloak UI or API.

The CRC service also brings changes to the user interface for launching
sessions, specifically when it comes to selecting compute resources for a
specific session. With this version we have grouped different pre-set
configurations of memory, CPU, RAM and GPU in resource classes. Resource classes
are further grouped in resource pools and users are asked to select the resource
pool and class they wish to use when they launch a session rather than
separately specify memory, CPU, RAM and GPU requirements. The selection for the
amount of disk storage required is also changed but now has more freedom than
before. Users can now select disk storage with a slider that only has a maximum
limit and no pre-set steps. For projects where the users have specified resource
requests in the project settings the UI will provide hints as to which resource
classes are suitable based on the settings. When the quick launch button is used
to start a session the closest equal or greater resource class based on the
project settings will be automatically selected.

Apart from the changes needed to support compute resource access features,
support has also been added for common R file extensions.

This release also includes a hotfix for an issue with the horizontal scaling of
the core-service where users could get redirected to the wrong service instance
and subsequent requests to the core-service would fail due to partial cache
misses.

0.24.0
------

Renku ``0.24.0`` introduces two new features: SSH-access to RenkuLab sessions
and a new RenkuLab Dashboard!

Would you like to work on your Renku project from the comfort of your own local
computer? Use the Renku CLI to start an SSH session on RenkuLab, and open that
session in your local terminal or even your IDE, such as VSCode. Check out the
"Connect with SSH" option in the Session Start menu to get started, or see our
`docs <https://renku.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how-to-guides/renkulab/ssh-into-sessions.html>`__.
*Note that SSH functionality must be enabled by your administrator and may not be
available on all RenkuLab deployments.*

And, your RenkuLab Dashboard now has a snazzy new look that puts your most used
projects, sessions, and datasets at your fingertips. Quickly pick up where you
left off: connect to your already-running sessions, start a new session on a
recently visited project, or access your datasets- all from a single page!

and ``gateway.traefik.volumes``. Refer to the `values file <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-gateway/blob/0.14.0/helm-chart/renku-gateway/values.yaml>`_
in the ``renku-gateway`` repo for more details.

0.12.1
------

Minor release to align Sentry configurations across the components.
It includes a few minor bug-fixes.


0.12.0
------

This is an important upgrade that enables v1.0 of `renku-python` (renku CLI) to work with the
renku web interface, renkulab. The upgrade requires regenerating the metadata in the knowledge
graph, which means that for a period of time, searching and accessing datasets and lineage
information will be limited and incomplete. The metadata regeneration is done automatically
and doesn't require any action from you.

Updating projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might be prompted to update your project to the new version of Renku. As a general rule,
this update should take less than 30 seconds, and we will provide an estimate of the time
required. The update will migrate the metadata for your project and, for most projects,
update the base image and the version of the Renku CLI used in interactive sessions. For
large projects with thousands of commits or many renku workflows, we recommend doing the
migration manually. Please don't hesitate to `reach out <https://renku.discourse.group>`_
or `open an issue <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku/issues>`_ if you
encounter problems or are unsure how to proceed.

Most importantly, from this point on, new projects created on renkulab will use renku
CLI ``>= v1.0``. We therefore strongly urge all users to have a look at the myriad of
excellent new features that this major release enables by checking out the
`renku-python release notes <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-python/blob/1.0.0-release-notes/renku-release-notes-1.0.0.md>`_.
This release completely changes the storage and generation of the knowledge graph metadata,
with vastly improved performance and functionality. We have gone to great lengths to
ensure a smooth transition for older projects and for continuity in the CLI, but
please report issues on `discourse <https://renku.discourse.group>`_ or
`GitHub <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku/issues>`_.

We hope you like the new features - if you have further questions suggestions for improvements, let us know!

Detailed release notes follow below.

Administrators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BREAKING CHANGES: carefully plan the outage for this upgrade. Because of the
underlying changes to the knowledge graph structure, the entire KG has to be
rebuilt. Based on our experience, this is orders of magnitude faster than in
earlier iterations, but depending on the number of projects it could still take
some time. The platform will be usable during this time, but KG features may not
fully work (e.g. dataset search)

* (gateway/notebooks) partial support for custom CA certificates

0.11.3
------

Minor release fixing a bug in the acceptance tests.


0.11.2
------

Minor release fixing a bug in the Renku template for Keycloak.


0.11.1
------

This is a minor release featuring improvements to the Renku UI.

New Feature highlights:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **UI**: updates to style of alerts, menus, and tables

* **User sessions**: allow stopping a session that is not fully started (`example stopping session <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku/blob/0.11.2/docs/_static/changelog-images/renku-ui-1.3.0-session-shutdown.gif>`_)

* **User sessions**: support links for sharing sessions with additional options (`example sharing a link <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku/blob/0.11.2/docs/_static/changelog-images/renku-ui-1.3.0-launch-links.gif>`_)

Note: this release also updates the version of the keycloak chart to ``16.0.4``,
but no manual admin action should be needed.

  `0.10.0 <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-gateway/releases/0.10.0>`__

Upgrading from 0.9.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**BREAKING CHANGES!!** The admin should plan and warn users ahead of time that their sessions will be terminated when doing the upgrade. The new ``Loud`` statuspage component introduced in `0.9.3` can help get  the message across.

* The use of Amalthea and removal of Jupyterhub will require some changes. Namely:
  - All references to Jupyterhub in the ``values.yaml`` have been removed and are not required anymore.
  - Amalthea is installed from a separate helm chart which is now a dependency of the ``renku-notebooks`` helm chart.
  - Several new sections have been added to the ``values.yaml`` file which are required by Amalthea. Please refer to the renku values file for more details.
* Some older images with Rstudio will open Rstudio in a directory one level above the repository. This can be fixed by upgrading to a newer version of the base image in the Dockerfile in the relevant renku project.
* This version is not backward compatible with the user sessions from older versions. During the deployment the admin should clean up all remaining user sessions and then deploy this version.
* Anonymous sessions do not require a separate namespace and renku-notebooks deployment, if enabled in the values file they now run in the same namespace as regular user sessions.

0.9.3
-----

This is a very minor release that allows messages about maintenance and downtime to be displayed more prominently in the UI. This way the interruptions from upcoming releases can be more effectively communicated to users.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **UI**: possibility to make maintenance/downtime notifications more prominently shown. To use this feature, the admin needs to create a new statuspage component called Loud and thick when wanting the message to appear more prominently.

0.9.2
-----

This is a bugfix release that includes various minor fixes: templates and core use a new bugfix CLI version, as well as other fixes for external to SDSC deployments and improved login style.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Sessions**: make enforced limits configurable when using ``emptyDir`` disk space.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* **Templates**: Renku and custom templates updated to use Renku ``0.16.2`` (should fix `pyshacl and renku conflicting dependencies <https://renku.discourse.group/t/failing-image-build/429/6>`__).
* **Renku core / CLI**: pin pyshacl to version ``0.17.0.post1``.
* **Login**: make social identity providers style match internal ones.
* **UI**: configurable welcome page for external deployments.

0.8.4
-----

This version of Renku introduces the ability to use persistent volumes for user sessions. This is optional and can be enabled in the values
file for the helm chart. In addition to enabling this feature users have the ability to select the storage class used by the persistent
volumes. We strongly recommend that a storage class with a `Delete` reclaim policy is used, otherwise persistent volumes from all user
sessions will keep accumulating.

Also, unlike previous versions, with 0.8.4 the amount of disk storage will be **strongly enforced**,
regardless of whether persistent volumes are used or not. With persistent volumes users will simply run out of space. However,
when persistent volumes are not used, going over the amount of storage that a user has requested when starting their session
will result in eviction of the k8s pod that runs the session and termination of the session. Therefore, admins are advised
to review and set proper options for disk sizes in the `notebooks.serverOptions` portion of the values file.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **UI**: Add banner advertising new version to logged-in users and various improvements in the new canary deployment itself.
* **Environments**: Ability to use persistent volumes for user sessions.

Upgrading from 0.8.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When upgrading from 0.8.3 the following steps should be taken based on whether you would like to use persistent volumes for user sessions or not:

**Use persistent volumes:**

  1. Edit the `notebooks.userSessionPersistentVolumes` section of the `values.yaml file <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku/blob/master/helm-chart/renku/values.yaml#L527>`_ changing the `enabled` flag to true and selecting a storage class to be used with every user session. It is strongly recommended to select a storage class with a `Delete` retention policy to avoid the accumulation of persistent volumes with every session launch.
  2. Review and modify (if needed) `the disk request options in the values.yaml file <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku/blob/master/helm-chart/renku/values.yaml#L506>`_.
  3. Review and modify (if needed) the `the server defaults in the values.yaml file <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku/blob/master/helm-chart/renku/values.yaml#L479>`_. These will be used if a specific server options is omitted in the request to create a session and should be compatible with any matching values in the `serverOptions` section. It also allows an administrator to omit an option from the selection menu that is defined in the `serverOptions` section and have renku always use the default from the `serverDefaults` section.

**Do not use persistent volumes:**

  1. Review and modify (if needed) `the disk request options in the values.yaml file <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku/blob/master/helm-chart/renku/values.yaml#L506>`_. Please note that if a user consumes more disk space than they requested (or more than what is set in the `serverDefaults` of the values file) then the user's session will be evicted. This is necessary because if a user consumes a lot of space on the node where their session is scheduled k8s starts to evict user sessions on that node regardless of whether they are using a lot of disk space or not. This sometimes results in the eviction of multiple sessions and not the session that is consuming the most storage resources.
  2. Review and modify (if needed) the `the server defaults in the values.yaml file <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku/blob/master/helm-chart/renku/values.yaml#L479>`_. These will be used if a specific server options is omitted in the request to create a session and should be compatible with any matching values in the `serverOptions` section. It also allows an administrator to omit an option from the selection menu that is defined in the `serverOptions` section and have renku always use the default from the `serverDefaults` section.

0.8.3
-----

This is a bugfix release that includes fixes to Knowledge Graph. For more details please check the renku-graph `1.36.6 <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-graph/releases/tag/1.36.6>`__ release notes.

0.8.2

Upgrading from 0.7.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**Breaking change**  Keycloak chart dependency has been upgraded from ``4.10.2`` to ``9.8.1`` which will trigger an irreversible database migration, check out `the upgrade instructions <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku/blob/master/helm-chart/README.rst#upgrading>`__ for more details.

Most notably, keycloak values are less nested, so at the level of the Renku chart values, keycloak.keycloak.X.Y becomes keycloak.X.Y. You can also check out `the instructions <https://github.com/codecentric/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/keycloak#upgrading>`__ on how to upgrade aspects not covered by default in the Renku chart.

If the Renkulab deployment includes keycloak, the values file should be modified as follows:
* DELETE - the section keycloak.keycloak.persistence has been removed. Database connection details are specified through the keycloak.extraEnv and keycloak.extraEnvFrom blocks. See the `Renku values file <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku/blob/0.7.8/helm-chart/renku/values.yaml#L129-L154>`__ for reference.
* EDIT - keycloak.keycloak.username has been moved to global.keycloak.user.

Finally, before applying the helm upgrade, the Keycloak statefulset should be deleted.

0.7.4
-----

This is a patch release that includes a notebooks change and some improvements to the Knowledge Graph.

0.7.3
-----

This release contains some very nice improvements to the file and datasets management and visualization as well as project migrations.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Dataset removal** A dataset can be now removed from a project, either from the UI or with the Renku CLI.

- **Pinned environments image** A project can pin interactive environments to a specific image, independent of the content of the project. This can be useful for situations like courses where everyone should use the environment defined by the instructor. To take advantage, see the `renku configuration file documentation <https://renku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/templates.html?highlight=.dockerignore#renku>`_.

- **Project migration** Project migration has been improved, allowing users to migrate the template, Dockerfile and Renku version with just one click. Information about the latest and current Renku CLI and template versions are displayed in the Status section of a project. Additionally, a migrationscheck command is available in Renku CLI.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Dataset upload** When uploading files, a progress bar is displayed.

- **Dataset visualization** For a better experience on dataset listing inside projects, description and author list have been cropped. The full content of both is still available when accessing the dataset.

- **File preview** Preview of C++ and Fortran files is supported.

- **File download** Files can be downloaded from the Renku UI.

- **Autosaved work** Commits with autosaved content are marked with ``*`` and dialog is more specific.

- **Autosave git LFS** When a session is closed and work is automatically saved, large files are added to LFS according to the project's settings see `renku config documentation <https://renku-python.readthedocs.io/en/v0.12.0/commands.html#available-configuration-values>`_.

- **Core** Renku CLI commit messages are shortened to 100 characters for readability.

- **New projects** Templates to create new projects now use the new Renku CLI version ``0.12.2`` by default.


Fixes
~~~~~

- **Auth credentials**: the way Renku environments handle git credentials has been improved.

-----

This release features an update to the default project templates, bumping
the default `renku CLI version to ``0.12.0`` <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-python/releases/tag/v0.12.0>`_
and some backend bug fixes.

Fixes
~~~~~

- **Graph building**: several improvements to graph building, including a fix
  for metadata compaction in renku-core that caused some entities to not
  get processed.


0.7.0
-----

This release brings a lot of important new features to both Renkulab and the
Renku CLI. It's our best one yet!

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Project templates**: you can now create custom templates for your projects and
  use them on project initialization. Great for groups or courses! See the
  `docs <https://renku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/templates.html>`_ for more
  details.

- **Datasets**: you can now search for datasets and import them into projects
  directly from the Renkulab web UI. The dataset import and creation flow has
  also been much improved thanks to changes in the core service backend. Note
  that importing datasets from other renku projects from the UI currently works
  only for datasets in public repositories.

- **Data import**: files can be imported into datasets directly from a URL.

- **Project migration**: the metadata of renku projects occasionally changes. In
  order for all the components to work well together, the metadata must be kept
  in sync. Previously you needed to do this manually with the CLI but now it's
  as easy as clicking a button.

- **Template simplification**: We have decoupled the CLI version from the base image and
  made it easier to override in your own environments. See the `project template
  README <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-project-template/blob/master/README.md>`_
  for details.

- **Improved editor**: All text editing components are using an enhanced editor
  that allows seamless switching between WYSIWYG and markdown.

- **renku save**: the Renku CLI now features a ``save`` command that
  simplifies the process of committing and pushing your project to the server.


Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Dataset deletion**: Datasets used to stick around even after getting deleted
  from the project. This has now been fixed and deleted datasets no longer appear in
  the dataset listings.

- **git credentials**: the interactive sessions now handle your git credentials
  in a way that allows you to seamlessly access any of your private repositories
  on renkulab from within an interactive session.

- **git hooks in interactive sessions**: git hooks were not previously installed
  per default in interactive sessions, which meant that some nice features like
  automatically pushing large files to LFS did not work correctly. This has now
  been corrected and should hopefully save many repositories from improperly
  handled data!

- **graph redesign**: Under the hood, the renku-python library has a completely
  redesigned knowledge graph model. This enormous effort doesn't translate to
  user-visible improvements yet, but they're coming in the next release!


Many other improvements and bug fixes across all of the renku components, which
have significantly improved the stability of the entire platform!


Upgrading user projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade your existing renkulab project to the latest images, the easiest is
if you copy/paste a ``Dockerfile`` that suits your project
(python/R/Bioconductor) from the `renku project templates repository
<https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-project-template/blob/master/python-minimal/Dockerfile>`_.

Note that even if you upgrade the image, the project in the repository will still
need to be migrated. You can do this on the command line by running ``renku
migrate`` in your project or follow the instructions in the UI when prompted.


Changes and improvements in the platform deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Breaking change: Postgresql chart**: we have switched to the Bitnami version
  of the Postgresql
  helm chart - this requires a manual intervention when upgrading from renku
  ``0.6.8``.

- **Kubernetes**: renku is now compatible with kubernetes >= 1.16 (tested on 1.16)

- **Helm3**: the renku helm charts are now compatible with helm 3
