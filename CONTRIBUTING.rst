Contributing to Renku
=====================

Want to contribute to Renku? Thanks! There are many ways to help, and we very much
appreciate your efforts.

The sections below provide guidelines for various types of contributions.

Bug Reports and Feature Requests
================================

**Do not report security issues as bugs**, instead email us at security@renku.io or create a `Github security advisory<https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku/security/advisories/new>`__

Bugs and feature requests should be reported on GitHub: https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku/issues

When reporting a bug, please include the following information:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Pull Requests
=============

If you do not already have a development environment set up, you will probably find the
`developer documentation`_ helpful.

* Before submitting a pull request, please make sure you agree to the license and have submitted a signed `contributor license agreement`_.
* PRs should include a short, descriptive title. The titles will be used to compile changelogs for releases, so think about the title in that context.
* Small improvements need not reference an issue, but PRs that introduce larger changes or add new functionality should refer to an issue.
* Structure your commits in meaningful units, each with an understandable purpose and coherent commit message. For example, if your proposed changes contain a refactoring and a new feature, make two PRs.
* Format commit messages using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style
* Follow the `software development guidelines <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku/blob/master/DEVELOPING.md>`__

Finally, if your change is for one of the renku subprojects, you should also consult the
guidelines for contributions within the subproject.
