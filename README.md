**Renku** is an open-source platform that connects the ecosystem of
data, code, and compute to empower researchers to build collaborative
communities. It is aimed at independent researchers and data scientists
as well as labs, collaborations, and courses and workshops.

Once a Renku project is configured, anyone using it can take advantage
of convenient access to data and code within pre-configured
computational sessions. Projects are assembled by piecing together:

- **Data connectors**: connect virtually any cloud-based or on-premise
  data source, like S3 buckets, WebDav or SFTP servers. Once you create a
  data connector, it can be reused across all of your projects and even be
  made available to your group or community.

- **Source code**: link the source code repositories you are used to, like
  GitHub or GitLab and easily work on it within your project sessions.

- **Compute environments**: use one of our pre-configure environments with
  VSCode, RStudio or Jupyter inside or have Renku build an image to match
  your repository\'s requirements. Alternatively, bring your own docker
  image and share it easily with others to really make your code and data
  sing.

> [!NOTE]
> Weâ€™re discontinuing Renku Legacy and the RenkuLab GitLab by January 2026
> to focus all development efforts on the newly launched version of Renku,
> [Renku 2.0](https://blog.renkulab.io/launch-renku-2/). To learn more, including how to maintain access to your Renku
> Legacy projects, see our [transition guide](https://blog.renkulab.io/sunsetting-legacy/#how-to-migrate-projects-from-renku-legacy-to-renku-20).

## Getting Started

A public instance of **RenkuLab** is available at
https://renkulab.io. To start exploring Renku, feel free to make an
account and try it out! You can follow the [hands-on

## Getting in touch

There are several channels you can use to communicate with us; we
monitor all of them, so your messages will always get to us, but
communication will be slightly more streamlined if you pick a channel
that most suits your purpose and needs.

- [discourse](https://renku.discourse.group): questions concerning
  Renkulab, your feature requests or feedback
- [github](https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku):
  create platform-usability and software-bug issues
- [gitter](https://gitter.im/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku):
  communicate with the team

Renku is developed as an open source project by the Swiss Data Science
Center in a team split between EPFL and ETHZ.

## Project structure

Renku is built from several sub-repositories:

- [renku-data-services](https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-data-services):
  backend services providing the majority of the platform user-facing
  functionality.
- [renku-ui](https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-ui): web
  front-end.
- [renku-gateway](https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-gateway):
  a simple API gateway.
- [amalthea](https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/amalthea): k8s
  operator for user session servers.
- [renkulab-docker](https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renkulab-docker):
  base images for interactive sessions.
