# Renku Docs

The easiest way to build the Renku documentation locally is to make use of [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) which will have the required dependencies installed.

Inside the `renku` repository run the following command to build the docs.

```bash
$ cd docs
$ make html
```
