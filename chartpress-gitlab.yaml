# this file should be used as and when necessary to build the renku gitlab helm
# chart. As renku moves to use of the standard gitlab cloud native chart, this
# will become redundnat but for now it is still in use.
#
# To use this, you will need to remove the chartpress.yaml for building renku and
# replace it with this file (it seems chartpress cannot work with a file other than
# one called chartpress.yaml).
#
# To build and push a release candidate chart do this:
# 
# chartpress --publish --tag x.y.z-rc.Q
#
# To publish a chart which is not a release candidate do this, making sure that
# your appropriate merges/commits are made before doing this:
# 
# chartpress --publish --tag x.y.z
