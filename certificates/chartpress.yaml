# The chartpress command has to be run where the chartpress.yaml file is located.
# However if this is located in helm-chart/certificates then the whole helm chart
# repo is downloaded in that folder when the chart is published, and the whole helm
# chart repository is then part of the certificates helm chart. This makes the 
# helm chart ~270MB and then it cannot be published on github pages due to the large size.
