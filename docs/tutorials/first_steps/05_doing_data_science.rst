Ways to do data science in Renku
--------------------------------

.. tabbed:: Jupyter Notebooks

    This is the main way Python and Julia users will interactively do data science.
    In the JupyterLab interface, use the file navigator in the left sidebar to go
    to the **Files** (1) tab. Here, you see a listing of files and folders from
    your project. To create a new notebook, first double-click on the **notebooks**
    folder (2), then on the **'+'** button (3). Select *Python 3* or 
    *Julia 1.\*.\** to create a new notebook (4).

    To rename the notebook, right-click on its name (``Untitled.ipynb``) and
    select rename.

    You can read more about JupyterLab in the `JupyterLab documentation
    <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ if you are not familiar with it
    already. You may want to take some time to play with the JupyterLab interface
    before continuing.

    To quickly save your work, the easiest is to use the ``renku save`` command from
    the terminal - this will commit any uncommitted files and sync the changes with
    the git server. You can specify a custom commit message with ``-m``.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ renku save -m "saving the new notebook"

        Successfully saved to branch master:
            notebooks/new notebook.ipynb
        OK

    Alternatively, if you want more control over the commit process, you can go to the console and use
    ``git`` to add your work to the repository. For example, if you want to keep
    the new notebook(s), run the following in the terminal:

    .. code-block:: console

        # track everything inside the notebooks folder
        $ git add notebooks
        $ git commit -m "Added some notebooks"
        $ git push

        [master 0fb9ac1] Added some notebooks
            1 file changed, 32 insertions(+)
            create mode 100644 notebooks/MyNewNotebook.ipynb

    If you prefer to use a GUI, an extension providing access to the basic git
    commands is built into JupyterLab. Click on the git icon on the left sidebar of
    JupyterLab (1) to open the git panel. Here, you can add untracked files by
    selecting them and clicking the up arrow (2). You can enter a commit message in
    (3) and click the ``Commit`` button. Finally, sync your changes with the server
    by clicking on the push icon (4).

.. tabbed:: RStudio

    The canonical way of working interactively with R is using the RStudio IDE.
    As default, there are four panels available in the user interface, which cover a
    code editor (1), Console/Terminal section (2), Environment panel (3) and
    a file explorer (4).

    We note that it is actually possible to run Jupyter Notebooks with an R kernel,
    if one navigates to the */lab* endpoint of the URL of the renku project. There
    you can select the R kernel and proceed as usual. However, we proceed with
    this part of the tutorial in RStudio.

    The R console and script editor can be used together to quickly prototype
    data pipelines. An advantage of RStudio is that the Environment panel will show
    all the data frames and variables stored in local memory. 

    In order keep R scripts organized, you may want to create a ``src`` folder in the 
    main project directory. 

    An important part of using renku within RStudio is accessing the Terminal (1). This
    is where you can access renku commands and make sure you have tracked changes 
    using git. The Git tab in the Environment panel (2) also gives you the option of a
    graphical user interface (GUI) to git.
