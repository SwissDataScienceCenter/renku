.. _add_data:

Add data to your project
------------------------

In the JupyterLab interface or RStudio files panel, we can see that a few files already exist.
Let's start by adding data using the `Renku CLI <https://renku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/renku-python/docs/reference/commands.html>`__.

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: JupyterLab
        :sync: jupyter

        For JupyterLab, start a terminal by clicking the **Terminal** icon (1)
        on the bottom right of the **Launcher** page.

        .. image:: ../../_static/images/jupyterlab-open-terminal.png
            :width: 85%
            :align: center
            :alt: Open terminal in JupyterLab

        If your JupyterLab interface does not have the launcher tab open, you can
        find it in the top bar menu in *File* > *New Launcher*.

        .. note::

            To paste commands to the JupyterLab console, use ``Cmd+V`` on MacOS or
            ``Ctrl+Shift+V`` on Linux.

    .. tab-item:: RStudio
        :sync: rstudio

        For RStudio, click the Terminal tab, which is next to the Console tab.

        .. image:: ../../_static/images/rstudio-open-terminal.png
            :width: 85%
            :align: center
            :alt: Open terminal in RStudio


When you start the terminal, you will already be inside your project
directory, so you are ready to create a dataset.

Renku can create datasets containing data from a variety of sources. It
supports adding data from the local file system or a URL. Renku can also
import data from a data repository like the
`Dataverse <https://dataverse.harvard.edu>`_ or `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org>`_.

Adding data from a remote repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The advantage of importing data from a data repository is that it can contain metadata that
can be used to help interpret it. Another advantage is that data repositories
assign `DOIs <https://www.doi.org>`_ to data which can be used to
succinctly identify it and guarantee that the data will be findable and
accessible for a longer period of time (usually at least 20 years).

The DOI for the
dataset we want to import is https://www.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WTZS4K

Execute the following line and when prompted if you really want to download the
data, answer yes.

.. code-block:: console

    $ renku dataset import --name flight-data https://www.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WTZS4K

    Output:
    CHECKSUM    NAME                       SIZE (MB)  TYPE
    ----------  -----------------------  -----------  ---------------
                2019-01-flights.csv.zip         7.56  application/zip
    Warning: Do you wish to download this version? [y/N]: y
    Info: Adding these files to Git LFS:
            data/flight-data/2019-01-flights.csv.zip
    To disable this message in the future, run:
            renku config set show_lfs_message False
    OK

Let us take a moment to understand what happened there. Opening the terminal
puts you inside the project directory with ``git`` already configured.

Then we imported a dataset  using the  `Renku CLI <http
://renku-python.readthedocs.io/>`__. Here, we can see the method of
referencing a dataset in a data repository by DOI. By doing so,
we capture a reference to the source of the data in the metadata of the
project.

You can list the datasets in a project by running the following:

.. code-block:: console

    $ renku dataset ls

    ID                                    NAME         TITLE               VERSION
    ------------------------------------  -----------  ------------------  ---------
    29f121ea-cf16-4512-932f-7b195480cb9b  flight-data  2019-01 US Flights  1.0

The file we added contains data on flight take-offs and landings at US airports, and it
comes originally from `here <https://www.transtats.bts.gov>`_. As the file
name suggests, this file covers data for January, 2019.

We can see that the two ``renku`` commands make use of the underlying git
repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git log

    Output similar to:
    commit 3809ce796933bd554ec65df0737b6ecf00b069e1

Adding data from the local file system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Often the data you wish to use on Renku is not available on a remote repository.
In this case you can either create a dataset using the RenkuLab UI or use the data upload user interface in JupyterLab
or RStudio. Within a running session, the latter is the easier option. For this example, suppose that we have downloaded the
``2019-01-flights.csv.zip`` file to our local computer and wish to upload this
to our Renku project and add it as a dataset. We start with working in the
terminal to set up the Renku dataset.

First let us create a Renku dataset called ``flight-data`` with the title
'2019-01 US Flights'.

.. code-block:: console

    $ renku dataset create flight-data --title "2019-01 US Flights"
    Creating a dataset ... OK

Then create a folder called ``flight-data`` in the ``data`` folder.

.. code-block:: console

    $ mkdir data/flight-data

Navigate to the ``flight-data`` folder and click on the upload button as shown
in the two examples below. Select the ``zip`` folder corresponding to our dataset and upload it.

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: JupyterLab
        :sync: jupyter

        .. image:: ../../_static/images/jupyterlab-upload-data.png
            :width: 85%
            :align: center
            :alt: Upload data in JupyterLab


        Note that in JupyterLab, ``zip`` folders are not automatically unzipped
        once they are uploaded. You should then see

        .. image:: ../../_static/images/jupyterlab-data-uploaded.png
            :width: 85%
            :align: center
            :alt: Uploaded data in JupyterLab

    .. tab-item:: RStudio
        :sync: rstudio

        .. image:: ../../_static/images/rstudio-upload-data.png
            :width: 85%
            :align: center
            :alt: Upload data in RStudio


        Note that in RStudio, ``zip`` folders are automatically unzipped once
        they are uploaded. You should then see

        .. image:: ../../_static/images/rstudio-data-uploaded.png
            :width: 85%
            :align: center
            :alt: Uploaded data in RStudio


For the rest of this tutorial, we continue with the assumption that
you have uploaded the data using the dataset import from the remote
repository as indicated in the previous section. That is, the ``csv`` file
will still be zipped in the proceeding sections.


After we upload the file, we need to add the file to the Renku dataset. Navigate
back to the working directory and add the file to the ``flight-data`` Renku
dataset.

.. code-block:: console

    $ renku dataset add flight-data data/flight-data/2019-01-flights.csv.zip
    Warning: Adding data from local Git repository: Use remote's Git URL instead to enable lineage information and updates.
    Info: Adding these files to Git LFS:
            data/flight-data/2019-01-flights.csv.zip
    To disable this message in the future, run:
            renku config set show_lfs_message False
    OK


Check that the right file has been associated with the ``flight-data`` Renku
dataset by running

.. code-block:: console

    $ renku dataset ls-files
    DATASET NAME    ADDED                  SIZE  PATH                                      LFS
