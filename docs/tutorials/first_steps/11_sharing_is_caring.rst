Share your results and collaborate with your peers
--------------------------------------------------

In this section, we will see how to use Renku to collaborate on projects. For
an overview on collaboration, see :ref:`collaborating`.

A view of Issues and Merge Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let us start by going back to the Renku web interface on renkulab.io_ or
whichever instance you are using for this tutorial. Make sure you are logged
in, so you can see your projects list by clicking on ``Projects`` in the top
navigation bar.

Click on your ``Flights-tutorial`` project to open it and then go to the 
**Collaboration** tab (1). Here we provide quick access into the GitLab Issues
and Merge Requests view. You can view and create new Issues and Merge Requests
directly from this view. It is probably empty
at the moment, so let us start a new discussion by clicking on the
**New Issue** button (2).

In the **New Issue** form, fill in the **Title** and **Description**
as follows.

* Title: Data source
* Description: Where does the data come from?

Click on **Submit issue**. The **Issues** sub tab should now list the newly created issue.

The issues can be viewed directly in this window.

Once the issue has been resolved, it can be closed in the same way (1).
