Define your Workflow in a Workflow File
---------------------------------------

The ``renku run`` command is great for tracking the use of a small number of
scripts. However, if you are building a processing pipeline that involves many
steps, we recommend to encode your workflow in a workflow file.


Introducing the Renku Workflow File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this example, we will use the same  ``filter_flights`` and ``count_flights``
scripts as in the prior parts of the tutorial, but this time we will encode our
workflow in a workflow definition file, rather than using the command line.

To create a workflow file in your Renku project, create a file called
``workflow.yml``.

We'll start by creating the simplest version of the Renku workflow file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: Flights Processing Pipeline
    steps:
        filter:
            command: python src/filter_flights.py data/flight-data/2019-01-flights.csv.zip data/output/flights-filtered.csv
            inputs:
                - src/filter_flights.py
                - data/flight-data/2019-01-flights.csv.zip
            outputs:
                - data/output/flights-filtered.csv

This workflow file defines the workflow's name and a sequence of steps. For now,
we've only included the first step of our workflow, which we've named
``filter``. Within the ``filter`` step, we define the command to run, and then
we tell Renku which parts of this command are inputs and outputs by copying
those paths into the relevant sections.

To run this workflow file, run:

.. code-block:: console

        $ renku run workflow.yml


Using Templating in a Workflow File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Renku provides a templating feature so that you never have to type the same
path twice. To take advantage of templating, instead of listing the inputs,
we'll assign each input and output a name (such as ``raw-flights``) and a
``path``. Then, we can reference those names in the ``command`` using ``$``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: Flights Processing Pipeline
    steps:
        filter:
            command: python $filter-py $raw-flights $filtered-flights
            inputs:
                filter-py:
                    path: src/filter_flights.py
                raw-flights:
                    path: data/flight-data/2019-01-flights.csv.zip
            outputs:
                filtered-flights:
                    path: data/output/flights-filtered.csv


A Multi-Step Workflow File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below, you can see what the full workflow file looks like for the two-step
workflow.

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: Flights Processing Pipeline
    steps:
        filter:
            command: python $filter-py $raw-flights $filtered-flights
            inputs:
                filter-py:
                    path: src/filter_flights.py
                raw-flights:
                    path: data/flight-data/2019-01-flights.csv.zip
            outputs:
                filtered-flights:
                    path: data/output/flights-filtered.csv

        count:
            command: python $count-py $filtered-flights $flight_count
            inputs:
                count-py:
                    path: src/count_flights.py
                filtered-flights:
                    path: data/output/flights-filtered.csv
            outputs:
                flight_count:
                    path: data/output/flights-count.csv


Executing a workflow file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Running `renku run workflow.yml` will execute all steps in the workflow file.

Renku also helps you run only portions of your workflow at a time. For example,
you can execute just one step of the workflow by referencing that step's name:

.. code-block:: console

        $ renku run workflow.yml filter

If we had a longer workflow, perhaps with 10 or more steps, we could specify a
subset of steps to run.

.. code-block:: console

        # runs the step 'filter' and every step after it.
        $ renku run workflow.yml filter:

        # runs every step before 'count', and the 'count' step
        $ renku run workflow.yml :count

        # runs every step between 'filter' and 'count', including 'filter' and 'count' themselves
        $ renku run workflow.yml filter:count


Adding more metadata to a workflow file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also provide further details in your workflow definition, such as a
`description` of each paramteter, and `keywords` that describe your workflow.

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: Flights Processing Pipeline
    description: The workflow in the Renku Tutorial
    keywords:
        - tutorial
    steps:
        filter:
            command: python $filter-py $raw-flights $filtered-flights
            description: Filter the raw flights data to only flights to the destination of interest
            inputs:
                filter-py:
                    path: src/filter_flights.py
                raw-flights:
                    description: The raw flights data
                    path: data/flight-data/2019-01-flights.csv.zip
            outputs:
                filtered-flights:
                    description: Flights to the destination of interest
                    path: data/output/flights-filtered.csv

        count:
            command: python $count-py $filtered-flights $flight_count
            description: Count the number of flights
            inputs:
                count-py:
                    path: src/count_flights.py
                filtered-flights:
                    description: Flights to the destination of interest
                    path: data/output/flights-filtered.csv
            outputs:
                flight_count:
                    description: Number of flights to the destination of interest
                    path: data/output/flights-count.csv
