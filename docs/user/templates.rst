.. _templates:

Templates in Renku
==================

Templates come in handy when you want to be able to use the same kind
of high level project structure, dependencies, and/or scripts layouts over and
over. The two main aspects of the project that can be templated are:

* the directory structure & files
* the Docker image that builds your environment

When you create a project on the RenkuLab platform, you can choose between
a few templates. You should see at least a Python setup (Basic Python Project)
and a R setup (Basic R Project). In many cases, you can use these templates
as-is (see the :ref:`directory_structure` below). If you prefer another
language, you require a different IDE, or the base templates don't meet your
needs for any other reason, you can create new ones!
Check out :ref:`sessions`.

Note that you can create projects that are specifically intended to be templates
that others can use by adding to the base Renku template. If you're familiar
with `Cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, you can
also create a cookiecutter template as a Renku project.

.. _directory_structure:

Directory Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default provided directory structure is the following.

``data`` and ``notebooks``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``data`` and ``notebooks`` directories are where you should keep your...
data (added via ``renku dataset``) and notebooks (by double-clicking on a
python3 or R kernel image from the JupyterLab instance while you're inside
the dir), respectively.
You can add further nesting of directories under these locations to keep your
project organized.

Moreover, you will probably want to create other top-level directories,
like ``src`` for keeping scripts that you create from your notebooks when
your analysis stabilizes, and ``docs`` if you wish to keep your documentation
separate from the analysis.

The ``.gitkeep`` files in these directories by default are a convention used to
git commit "empty" directories (where normal git behavior is to omit empty
directories).

``environment.yml`` and ``requirements.txt``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

These two files are where you write in your conda (``environment.yml``) and pip
(``requirements.txt``) library dependencies. This is so that when you kill a
notebook or anyone forks your project, (re)starting a session will pre-install your libraries.

To make it easy to remember to write your dependencies to this file, instead of
``pip install <library>`` in a terminal, for instance, you can get into the
habit of running ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

``.gitignore``
""""""""""""""

This is your typical .gitignore file that you use for git projects. Write into
here any files that you don't want to be tracked.

.. _gitlab_ci_yml:

``.gitlab-ci.yml``
""""""""""""""""""

This yml file is for "continuous integration" in GitLab. It is configured so
that every time you make a commit, your project's docker image is rebuilt. In
most cases, this build should be successful. If, however, you are making
modifications to the ``Dockerfile``, you should pay attention to the CI/CD tab
in GitLab to check for failing builds. Take a look
at :ref:`sessions`.

``Dockerfile``
""""""""""""""

When you run the notebook server, a Docker image is built for your project as
defined by this ``Dockerfile``. The FROM line in this ``Dockerfile`` defines
which Renku Docker image sets up the base of your project; this includes
dependencies for the Renku CLI, JupyterLab, and maybe R kernels & RStudio,
depending on which template you selected upon project creation.

The lines following ``FROM`` define the installation of your own software
dependencies; they are the instructions for conda/pip installations of the
libraries in your ``requirements.txt`` file. If there's nothing special
about the libraries you're installing, you wont have to make changes to this
file. Else, check out :ref:`sessions`.

``.dockerignore``
"""""""""""""""""

The ``.dockerignore`` file is just like a ``.gitignore`` file, in that it allows
you to specify which files to ignore in a docker build. If you are not making
changes to the docker build, you can .dockerignore this file.

``README.md``
"""""""""""""

The ``README.md`` file is shown on a project's home page. It's good to have at
least the name of the project and a brief overview of the project for your
intended audience.

.. _renku_ini:

``.renku``
""""""""""

The ``.renku`` directory includes a ``renku.ini`` file which contains
project-level configuration for renku, stored using the
`INI format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>`_. Currently, it
can be used to specify defaults values for launching sessions.

**Sessions**

If your project has specific resources requirements to run, or if it should
default to RStudio or anything other than JupyterLab, then you will want to
provide a configuration for the sessions.

Although the file may be modified manually, it is recommended to use the
``renku config set interactive.<property> <value>`` command.

Here is the list of properties that can be customized in a standard Renkulab
deployment:

* ``default_url [string]``: URL to use when starting a new session (``/lab``, ``/tree``, ...)
* ``cpu_request [float]``: CPUs quota (``0.5``, ``1``, ...)
* ``mem_request [string]``: memory quota (``1G``, ``2G``, ...)
* ``gpu_request [int]``: GPU quota (``0``, ``1``, ...)
* ``lfs_auto_fetch [bool]``: whether to automatically fetch lfs files or not
  (``true``, ``false``)
* ``image [string]``: optional pinned Docker image
  (``registry.renkulab.io/namespace/my-project:a1b2c3d``)

.. note::

    We use JupyterLab as the default web interface for sessions.
    If you work in R, you may prefer to have RStudio. This can be
    achieved by using `/rstudio` as the ``default_url`` instead of `/lab`.

    .. code-block:: console

      > renku config set interactive.default_url "/rstudio"

    Verify that your ``renku.ini`` file looks like the following.

    .. code-block:: console

      [renku "interactive"]
      default_url = /rstudio

    If you ran this command locally, you will need to push back to the renkulab
    server, e.g.,

    .. code-block:: console

      > git push

    before this change is available (`renku config` automatically creates a
    commit).

    You can now start a new environment against the latest commit and you will
    have RStudio as the default web interface.

.. note::

    Using the same approach as above for RStudio, it is possible to switch the
    interface from JupyterLab to the classic Jupyter Notebook by using `/tree`
    as the ``default_url`` instead of `/lab`.

    .. code-block:: console

      > renku config set interactive.default_url "/tree"



What can I touch? What should I not touch?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What you should or should not touch depends on how well aligned your project is
with the defaults that Renku provides. Here are two example use cases:

User #1: Default everything
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

You're a python developer and you're ok with JupyterLab and the version of
python provided by the base template. You install all of your libraries with
pip or conda. While you work on this project, you can feel comfortable
modifying the following (as well as creating your own directories and
subdirectories to match your project's structure):

* ``data`` and ``notebooks`` directories
* ``.gitignore``
* ``requirements.txt`` (pip) and ``environment.yml`` (conda)
* ``README.md``

User #2: Extra dependencies
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

You want a different version of python than the one provided, you want to
install software that requires additional non-python/R dependencies, or you
want to make other changes, and you're comfortable editing Dockerfiles. In
addition to the files above, you might modify the following.
Consult :ref:`sessions`.

* ``Dockerfile``
* ``.dockerignore``
* ``.gitlab-ci.yml``

.. warning::

  Modifying these files can result in an image that does not build. Resetting to
  default values and killing and restarting the notebook should bring you back
  to a working state.

You can add any extra directories, sub-directories, and files anywhere without
a problem, but you probably want to leave the dotfiles in the level that
they're in in the default templates. Some of the integrated tools expect to
find these files in the top level of the project and will fail otherwise.

What else could be templated?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here are some other aspects of a project that could make use of a template:

* documentation
* subdirectories for keeping different parts of a project (note that you'll
  want to add ``.gitkeep`` files into empty directories to be able to git
  commit them)
* python scripts with ``argparse`` set up for inputs and outputs
* ``Dockerfile`` with installation of alternate IDE

One way to write templates for these aspects of the project is to create them
with `Cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
Cookiecutter is a CLI that creates projects from project templates. You can
define your own templates, or check out some of the
`curated cookiecutters <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#data-science>`_.
Note that some of these clash with the `renku` templates (i.e. content in
`Dockerfile`, `.gitignore`, etc.). As long as you read the docs above to
understand which parts are required for `renku`, you should be able to merge
these manually.

.. _create_template_repo:

Create a template repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We maintain an
`official Renku template repository <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-project-template>`_
that provides a few basic templates you can use to initiate your projects.
That should cover the most common use cases, but we assume users want to
create their own templates to speed up the bootstrap phase of a new project.

The easiest way to create your own templates is to clone our
`Renku template repository <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-project-template>`_
and modify it as you need.


.. _manifest-yaml:

``manifest.yaml``
"""""""""""""""""

The
`manifest file <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-project-template/blob/master/manifest.yaml>`_
contains all the specifications needed by the ``renku init`` function to
create a new project. You can specify multiple templates in the same
repository. Each of them requires an entry with the following parameters:

* ``folder``: the target folder inside the repository where the template files
  are stored. Please use a different folder for each template.
* ``name``: a short user-friendly name.
* ``description``: a brief description of your template. This will be
  presented to the user when choosing between templates.
* ``variables``: we support the
  `Jinja template engine <https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/>`_ in both
  file content and filenames. You can therefore ask users for specific values
  for any number of variables. The syntax is
  ``<variable_name>: <variable_description>``, where the name will be used as
  the variable name provided to the engine and the description will be
  presented to the user to explain the variable's intended use.
* ``allow_template_update``: When set to ``true``, indicates that this
  template supports being updated. When the template gets updated, projects
  created from it will get updated with the new template files. Defaults to
  ``false``. Also see ``immutable_template_files``.
* ``immutable_template_files``: A list of file paths inside the template
  (relative to the project root) that should not be changed by users for
  ``allow_template_update`` to work. Users changing any of these files will
  get a warning when trying to commit those changes. Template files not in
  this list won't get updated on template update if they were modified by a
  user. If a user does change one of these files, automated template update
  is no longer supported on that project, to prevent broken/inconsistent
  projects.

In addition to the custom variables mentioned above, we also provide some
renku-specific variables that are always available in templates, namely:

* ``name``: The name of the project.
* ``__template_source__``: The git repository the template originated from or
  ``renku`` if the template was distributed as a part of ``renku-python``.
* ``__template_ref__``: The branch/tag of the template repository.
* ``__template_id__``: The id of the template inside the repository.
* ``__repository__``: The repository where the project resides in (only set
  when creating a project online in renkulab).
* ``__namespace__``: The project namespace (only set when creating a project
  online in renkulab).
* ``__sanitized_project_name__``: Sanitized name of the project (without
  special characters) as used in Gitlab and URLs.
* ``__project_slug__``: The project slug (``<namespace>/<sanitized project
  name>``) (only set when creating a project online in renkulab).
* ``__renku_version__``: Renku version to be used for the project.


Use custom template repositories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you installed the renku command-line interface locally, you can specify a
template repository as an argument to the ``renku init`` command. If you do
this, we recommend that you **also** specify a tag (or a commit) when creating
a new project from a custom repository to ensure that the action is reproducible.
You can find further details in
`renku init docs <https://renku-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands.html#use-a-different-template>`_.

If you are using a RenkuLab instance, you can use a custom template repository by
changing the `Template source` to ``Custom`` on the project creation page. There,
you will be able to insert a URL pointing to your template repository.

.. image:: ../_static/images/templates_custom.png
  :width: 100%
  :align: center
  :alt: Custom template source

Fill in the reference and click on `Fetch templates`. This will parse and
validate the repository, showing the list of available templates.

An error may occur while fetching the templates for many reasons.
Most of the time, the template repository is invalid (in that case,
:ref:`double-check the manifest file<manifest-yaml>`), or the URL/reference
combination is wrong. The UI should show a meaningful error description.

.. note::

  Remember to provide the URL to the **git repository**. For GitHub and
  other code management systems, you can provide the link used to clone
  through ``https``, ending with ``.git``. You can usually leave the
  ``.git`` extension out, but pay particular attention when you try to
  copy-paste directly from your browser. Even an additional final slash can
  lead to an invalid URL, and the error may be confusing.
  This is what you get if you use
  `https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-project-template/` instead
  of `https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-project-template`:

  .. image:: ../_static/images/templates_url_error.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center
    :alt: Error fetching custom templates

If you think your template may be useful for the broader community, you can
have more visibility by including it in the
`community-contributed project templates repository <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/contributed-project-templates>`_.
Feel free to open a pull request and we will validate it.

If you are working in a dedicated RenkuLab deployment and your local
community needs the templates, you should contact the administrators to
include your repository in the RenkuLab template source through the
`renku-values file <https://renku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/index.html#create-a-renku-values-yaml-file>`_.


Create shareable project-creation links with pre-filled fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are times where you may have many users that each need to create their
own repository, but some of the parameters are shared across all the
repositories. An example could be in a course where each student needs their
own repository, but all should use the same template and metadata.

For this case, it is possible to generate a project-creation link containing
metadata embedded in a query parameter. When that link is entered in a
web browser, the UI will  automatically fetch the required information and
pre-fill the fields.

To create a shareable link, start by filling in all the fields as you would
do when creating a new project. Instead of clicking on `Create project`,
click on the dropdown on the right side of the same button and then on
`Create link`.

You should see a modal dialog where you can select which fields to include
in the metadata. Some may not be clickable (no value provided), and others
are deselected by default. The URL updates in real-time and can be copied to
share with others.

.. image:: ../_static/images/templates_shareable_link.png
  :width: 100%
  :align: center
  :alt: Custom template source

.. note::

  You can include any of the listed fields in the link, but you should be
  careful when including namespace and visibility. Your user namespace cannot
  be available to any other users, and group namespaces may require specific
  permission. The visibility is generally tied to the namespace visibility,
  although ``private`` should always be available since it is the most
  restrictive one.

  It would be best to prefer fixed references for custom template
  repositories, especially when selecting a template and providing values for
  variables. This means commits and tags are a good choice, while branches
  are not. Otherwise, the template or the variables may change in a later
  version, resulting in a corrupted link.


Programmatically compute shareable links
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The shareable link generation process is trivial but not intuitive since the
base64 encoded string obfuscates the details (we do that to prevent problems
with special chars in the URL).

If you need to to compute the shareable links programmatically, all you need is
to create a dictionary with the necessary information, serialize it to a Json
string, and base64 encode it.

We use the ``stringify`` function from the
`JavaScript JSON object <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON>`_
to serialize the dictionary, and a minor variation of the
`JavaScript btoa function <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/btoa>`_
to base64 encode the string. You can use them as a reference. All the major
programming languages have a straight equivalent in their base packages.

The structure of the dictionary is the following:

.. code-block:: console

  {
    "title": <string>,
    "namespace": <string>,
    "visibility": <string>,
    "url": <string>,
    "ref": <string>,
    "template": <string>,
    "variables": {
      <variable_name>: <string>
    }
  }

Here is an example with Python:

.. code-block:: python

  # 1. Create a dictionary with all the required data

  raw_data = {
    "title":"test",
    "url":"https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-project-template",
    "ref":"0.1.17",
    "template":"Custom/python-minimal",
    "variables": {
      "description":"test description"
    }
  }

  # 2. Serialize to a string

  import json
  serialized_data = json.dumps(raw_data)

  # 3. Encode in base64
  import base64
  data = base64.b64encode(str.encode(serialized_data))

  # 4. Use the output to compose the URL
  print(data)

  > b'eyJ0aXRsZSI6ICJ0ZXN0IiwgInVybCI6ICJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vU3dpc3NEYX
    RhU2NpZW5jZUNlbnRlci9yZW5rdS1wcm9qZWN0LXRlbXBsYXRlIiwgInJlZiI6ICIwLjEuMT
    ciLCAidGVtcGxhdGUiOiAiQ3VzdG9tL3B5dGhvbi1taW5pbWFsIiwgInZhcmlhYmxlcyI6IH
    siZGVzY3JpcHRpb24iOiAidGVzdCBkZXNjcmlwdGlvbiJ9fQ=='

  # The link will be
  # https://<renkulab_url>/projects/new?data=eyJ0aXRs...biJ9fQ==

The final string may be slightly different based on the specific library
used or the local settings (E.G., including spaces in the serialized
object string, produces extra characters).
