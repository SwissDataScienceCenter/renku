Sessions on RenkuLab
====================================

RenkuLab provides convenient interactive computing environments based on
`JupyterLab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. You can use them
to quickly access your project in fully-configured Python, RStudio or Julia
sessions. They make it easy to collaborate by providing reproducible
computational sessions for everyone working together on a project. They can even
be used to host interactive dashboards running on live data for use in demos or
presentations.

All aspects of creating, using, and modifying interactive sessions on RenkuLab
are covered on the pages that follow:
