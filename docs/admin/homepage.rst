Configuring the RenkuLab Homepage
---------------------------------

Homepage
~~~~~~~~

The homepage is shown at the root URL of a RenkuLab instance to a non-logged-in visitor.
(A logged-in visitor sees the ``Welcome`` page.)
By default, this page shows an explanation of the features of RenkuLab, but its content
is configurable by altering the ``renku/values.yaml`` file.

Configuring the content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There two pieces of information that most deployments will want to customize: the
link to the tutorial and the list of projects to highlight on the homepage.

ui.homepage.tutorialLink
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``ui.homepage.tutorialLink`` contains the URL that is used when a user navigates to
the tutorial. The default is to take the user to the tutorial in the documentaion:
https://renku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/01_firststeps.html. If your
deployment has a custom tutorial, for example, one hosted on the deployment itself,
you can replace the link to the tutorial.

ui.homepage.projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A deployment may want to highlight certain projects that are hosted on it.
The field ``ui.homepage.projects`` makes that possible. It contains a list of projects,
which are by default empty. To get your projects here you should povide a list of 
objects with the field ``projectPath``, which should contain the fully qualified name
of the projects. E.g.,::

  projects:
    - projectPath: renku-tutorials/e-rum-2020
    - projectPath: covid-19/covid-19-forecast

Replacing the content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the default content is not appropriate for your deployment, it is also possible 
to replace what is shown on the homepage.

There are three values that control the main content on the homepage: ``ui.homepage.custom.enabled``,
``ui.homepage.custom.main.contentMd``, and ``ui.homepage.custom.main.backgroundImage.url``

ui.homepage.custom.enabled
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``ui.homepage.custom.enabled`` needs to be set to ``true`` to enable overriding the homepage content. If left empty
or set to something else, the customization settings will be ignored and the standard
RenkuLab homepage will be shown.

ui.homepage.custom.main.contentMd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This variable stores the text that will be shown. Content should be provided in
`Markdown syntax <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>`_.
If ``ui.homepage.custom.enabled == true``, but ``ui.homepage.custom.main.contentMd`` is empty, then dummy
content is shown indicating that something should be provided here.

ui.homepage.custom.main.backgroundImage.url
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the text is presented over a standard background image. If you wish
to provide a different background, you may do so by setting this variable to the URL 
for the background you want to show. Any format supported by the ``background-image`` 
property in CSS is allowed, including PNG, JPG, and SVG.

.. note::

  The background color for the surrounding content is ``#01192D``, ``rgb(1, 25, 45)``. 
  To achieve a seamless look, you should probably should use this color in at least border 
  of your image.

.. note::

   A convenient place to store an image you want to use would be in a Git repository
   hosted in the GitLab used by RenkuLab. The repo can be a plain Git repo (it does not
   need to be a Renku repo).
