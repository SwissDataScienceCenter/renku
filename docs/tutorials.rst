     **We're building the next version of Renku!** If you're looking for a tutorial for Renku 2.0,
     please see the Renku 2.0 documentation on our `Community Portal
     <https://renku.notion.site/Renku-Community-Portal-2a154d7d30b24ab8a5968c60c2592d87>`_ instead.
     The tutorial linked below is outdated and refers to the legacy version of Renku that is no
     longer under active development. To learn more about the big changes coming in Renku, check out
     our `blog post <https://blog.renkulab.io/renku-2/>`_.

The following tutorials are available for getting acquainted with Renku. We recommend
you start with :ref:`first_steps`!

After that, if you'd prefer to work on a Renku project on your own machine rather than via a browser on RenkuLab,
take a look at the How-To Guide section for :ref:`how-to-own-machine`.

to request more topics.
