title: Upgrading Renku
---

We release new minor versions of Renku roughly every month. Bug fixes and patch
releases may happen at a higher frequency. Nevertheless, we recommend for administrators
who deploy and operate Renku to keep their deployments up to date and to check the 
[Renku releases page](https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku/releases) 
on our Github repo at least every 2 weeks.

Regardless of the type of the release (major, minor or patch) administrators should read the release
notes to understand what will be changed with the release. We have a section in the release
notes dedicated administrators which is useful and we encourage administrators to not skip this.

## Patch

Patch or bug fix releases can usually be applied without any downtime or impact to users.
These can also contain security fixes and as such should be applied as soon as possible.

## Major or Minor

Major or minor releases can contain more extensive, potentially breaking changes.
And planinig and potentially downtime may be required in order for the upgrade to be applied.

:::warning
When you are behind more than one minor version on your upgrades, we recommend upgrading to each
minor version one-by-one rather than skipping over several minor versions at once.
