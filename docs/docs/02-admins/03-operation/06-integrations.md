title: Integrations and Connected Services
---

Renku uses integrations so that users can easily gain access to resources
from third party sources. Currently these are limited to code repositories.
But work is underway to expand this to container registries and different
compute platforms such as HPC clusters. All of these integrations or connected
services are just OAuth2 clients to 3rd party services or applications.

Therefore, for every integration there are 2 steps:
1. Creating the client at the 3rd party application (e.g. at Gitlab.com).
2. Adding the client configuration in Renku from the admin console.

:::note
You need to be a Renku administrator in order to add integrations. You can assign
the administrator role by following the steps [here](08-user-management.md).

## Creating Integrations

Currently we support only a few integrations. The steps to create and register the clients
for each are described below.

### Gitlab

This can be used with `Gitlab.com` or with any other Gitlab deployment. You can also
register more than one client of the "Gitlab" kind.

#### Create the client in Gitlab

1. Navigate to your Gitlab deployment and log in. You may create the application
as an admin or even as a regular user as long as your specific Gitlab deployment
allows this.
    :::info
    Some Gitlab deployments have the option to create applications disabled.
    If this is the case you have to request this setting to be changed by the
    administrators of your Gitlab deployment.
    :::
2. Click on your profile picture in Gitlab and then navigate to `Preferences`.
3. Click on `Applications`.
4. Click `Add new application`.
5. Write a descriptive name for the application
6. Specify the redirect URL based the base URL of your Renku deployment 
like `https://<server-name>/api/data/oauth2/callback`. For example,
if your Renku deployment is at `https://renkulab.io` then the callback will be 
`https://renkulab.io/api/data/oauth2/callback`.
7. Use the following scopes:
    - `read_api`
    - `read_repository`
    - `write_repository`
    - `read_registry`
8. Save the client ID and secret that were generated once you created the application.
These will be needed in the steps to follow below.

From this point on you need to navigate to your Renku deployment and log in as an administrator.
You can follow the steps below to finish adding the integration.

#### Create the integration in Renku

1. Log into Renku and navigate to the admin panel.
2. Come up with an identifier for the integration and fill that in the `Id` field.
Some people use the domain of the Gitlab deployment as the `Id`.
2. Select `Gitlab` in the `Kind` field dropdown menu.
3. You can skip the `Application slug` field and leave it blank.
4. Provide a concise but clear descriptive name that your users can understand for the `Display Name` field.
5. Specify the base URL for the Gitlab deployment, for example `https://gitlab.com`.
6. Specify the client ID and secret that you received when you created the application in the 
Gitlab pages for the corresponding `Client ID` and `Client Secret` fields.
7. Specify the same scopes in the `Scope` field that you requested when you created the application
in the Gitlab pages in the steps above. List these separated by spaces like:

```
read_api read_repository write_repository read_registry
```

### GitHub.com

#### Create the client in GitHub

1. Navigate to `https://github.com`.
2. You can create the Renku client as part of your own profile or an organization.
It is more maintanable if you create the client as part of an organization rather than
as an individual user. 
    1. To create the client in an organization, navigate to the settings 
    page for the organization and then to `GitHub Apps` -> `New GitHubApp`. 
    2. To create the client as part of a specific user, navigate to your profile settings page
    then to `Developer settings` -> `GitHub Apps` -> `New GitHub App`.
3. You should now see the form for adding the application. 
4. Name the Github application. GitHub will derive a slug from this name that you will need when you
register the integration in Renku.
5. Fill in the description which will be displayed to users when they connect the integration
and are asked to log into GitHub.
6. For the `Homepage URL` use the URL of your Renku deployment.
7. The `Callback URL` is based on the URL of your Renku deployment 
like `https://<server-name>/api/data/oauth2/callback`. For example,
if your Renku deployment is at `https://renkulab.io` then the `Callback URL` will be 
`https://renkulab.io/api/data/oauth2/callback`.
8. Under the `Webhook` section uncheck the `Active` checkbox.
9. In the `Permissions` section select the following permissions:
    - `Repository permissions` -> `Contents` -> `Read and write`
    - `Repository permissions` -> `Packages` -> `Read-only`
10. For the question at the bottom asking `Where can this GitHub App be installed` select `Any account`.
11. Click `Create GitHub App`
12. The URL where your browser page gets redirected to once you have created the app
will contain the slug of the application. Save this version of the name because you will need it
in the `Application slug` field in the Renku forms to add the integration. The url is different based on whether
you are creating the application at the user or organization level.
    - Organization: `https://github.com/organizations/<organization>/settings/apps/<application-slug>`
    - User: `https://github.com/settings/apps/<application-slug>`
13. You will need to request a client secret to be created, one does not get created automaitcally.
You can do this by clicking the `Generate a new client secret` button once you have created the application.
12. Save the `Client ID` and client secret because you will need them in the steps to follow.

#### Create the integration in Renku

1. Log into Renku and navigate to the admin panel.
2. Come up with an identifier for the integration and fill that in the `Id` field.
Some people use the domain of the external service as the `Id`. For eample in this case `github.com`.
3. Select `Github` in the `Kind` field dropdown menu.
4. Fill in the `Application slug` field, this is required for Github providers.
There are instructions in the steps above on how to find the application slug.
5. Provide a concise but clear descriptive name that your users can understand for the `Display Name` field.
6. Specify the base URL for Github (i.e. `https://github.com`) in the `URL` field.
7. Specify the client ID and secret that you received when you created the application in the 
GitHub pages for the corresponding `Client ID` and `Client Secret` fields.

### Enterprise GitHub

The steps for enterprise GitHub are almost identical to the steps for `GitHub.com`.
The main difference is that when you register the integration in Renku in the `URL` field you should provide
the specific URL for your GitHub deployment which is different from `https://github.com`.

## Testing Integrations

After you have created an integration, you should test it to ensure that it is functioning properly.
It is very easy to have a typo in some of the configurations which will cause the integration to not work.

Here are the steps needed to test an integration you have just added:
1. Navigate to the `Integrations` page by logging in, clicking on your profile in
the top right corner and selecting `Integrations` from the menu.
2. Find the  integration you just added and click the `Connect` button. 
3. Fully complete the login flow by logging into the 3rd party service (i.e. Gitlab.com).
Once the login flow is complete you will redirected back to Renku and the integration should
have a status that reads `Connected`
    :::note
    If you do not have an account at the 3rd party service, then either create one
    or ask one of the Renku users that has an account to test the integration.
    :::
4. Try to access the resources from the 3rd party service in a session. For example for code repositories,
try to add a repository to a project and check that you can both pull and push to the repository.
