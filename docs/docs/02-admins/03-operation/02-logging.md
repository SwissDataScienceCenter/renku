title: Logging

We use [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) for log aggregation and searching
in production. However there are many alternatives here and depending on whether
or not you use a managed Kubernetes cluster you may be getting a logging solution
that is part of your cloud provider and is pre-installed in your cluster.
