# First Steps Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through creating a Renku project related to weather data in the city of Genova. For this project, data stems from Zenodo and the code is provided in a GitLab repository.

In [RenkuLab](https://renkulab.io/), you will bring data and code together in an interactive session where you can do any analysis and seamlessly share with others. **Let’s get started!**

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />

```
