# Writing Documentation in Renku (Renku’s Markdown)

# Basic Formatting

We support basic markdown, like headings, bullets, etc…

```
# Primary Heading
## Secondary heading

A paragraph is one or more lines of text followed by at least one blank line.

*Single asterisks represent italics*, _as do underlines_;
**Text in double asterisks is rendered in bold**

> Lines beginning with 'greater than' are shown as blockquotes.

* bullet
* list

~~text inside double tildes is crossed through~~
```

# Links

You can create an inline link by wrapping the link display text in brackets `[ ]`, followed by the linked URL in parentheses `( )` with no space in between.
