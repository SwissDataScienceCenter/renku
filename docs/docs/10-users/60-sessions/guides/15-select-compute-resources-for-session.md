# Select compute resources for your session

To change which resource class your project’s session launcher uses, you can edit the default resource class used by your session launcher:

1. Click on the session launcher in your project
2. Navigate to “Default Resource Class” and click the pencil icon to change the resource class.

import selectResourceVideo from './select-compute-resources-for-session-10.mov';

<video controls width="100%" src={selectResourceVideo} />

:::tip

Do you need more resources than are available in RenkuLab’s public resource classes? [Contact](../../community) us! We can configure a custom resource pool for your needs upon demand.

:::

If you would **temporarily** launch a session with different resources without changing the default resource class of the launcher, you can also select a resource class on the fly:

1. Click on the dropdown button in **Launch**
2. Select **Custom launch**.
3. Choose a resource class for this session

<video controls width="100%" src={selectResourceVideo} />
