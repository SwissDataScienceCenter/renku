    # What does work
    
    - Launch interactive Renku sessions at CSCS on: `Eiger` and `Bristen`
        - Sessions on `Daint` , `Clariden` work, but only with special images created by the Renku team. Simplified integration with ARM clusters is coming soon. Please [Contact us](/docs/users/community) for more info.

    - Access data from scratch, store and home

    - By default, the job is submitted against your default CSCS account

                    1. Open your session launcher side panel
                    2. Scroll down to the Environment variables section
                    3. Add an environment variable with key `SLURM_ACCOUNT` and set the value to your CSCS organisation (e.g. `g159`).

    - “Create from code” environments and Global environments work (on Eiger only)

                    At the moment, only special images work on Daint. The [testing project](https://staging.dev.renku.ch/p/flora.thiebaut/demo-hpc-clean#launcher-01K604HWZBNTTVD9G8VKATVJ8Z) comes with a launcher suitable for Daint. Here’s how to test on Daint in your own project (we will integrate this into RenkuLab more properly later!):
                    1. Create a session launcher with an **External Environment**
                    2. For the configuration, copy configuration from [this session launcher](https://staging.dev.renku.ch/p/flora.thiebaut/demo-hpc#launcher-01K5XTKBQK4XCCB6WTAQ7AVZJZ).
                    3. Ask to be added to a Daint resource pool
                    </p>
                    Tested: has torch and reports cuda access to 4 GPUs
                    </details>

    - Code repositories added to the Renku project are added to your session
