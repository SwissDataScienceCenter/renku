Renku offers two ways to collaborate as a group: together on a single project, or as a group working on multiple projects. 

## Collaborating on a single project

If your group is only working together on one project, we recommend to create a project and add all group members to that project.

Follow these How-To Guides to get started:

[How to create a new project](/docs/users/projects/guides/create-a-project) 

[How to add people to a project](/docs/users/collaboration/guides/add-people-to-project) 

For an overview of the roles you can give people on a project, see [Project Roles](Permissions,%20Roles,%20and%20Access%20Rights%20%5Bdeprecated%5D%209c0aea98b26c4c02ba6323326fa949e1.md).

## Collaborating on multiple projects

If you want to use Renku for your group and you will have multiple projects, we recommend creating a group. This will make it easier to manage who has access to a collection of projects and data connectors.
