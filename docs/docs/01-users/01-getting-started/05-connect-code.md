# Connect Code

For this project, we've created a [code
repository](https://gitlab.renkulab.io/learn-renku/air-quality-analysis) for this project on GitLab.
We can connect this git repository to our Renku project in order to use it in our session.

Here's how to add the code repository to your project:

1. Click on **+** under the Code Repositories section.
2. Copy and paste the link to Clone with HTTPS from your git project. 
In this case, we already provide you with the code here:Â 

    ```
    https://gitlab.renkulab.io/learn-renku/air-quality-analysis.git
    ```
