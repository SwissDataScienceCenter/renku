The only difference is whether you set a password on the folder.

### Create a ‚Äúpublic link‚Äù for your Switchdrive (or Polybox) folder

In Switchdrive/PolyBox:

1. From the folder containing the data you want to mount (not the data file itself!), click on the **three dots**
2. Click on ‚Äò**Public links**‚Äô
3. Click ‚Äò**Create public link**‚Äô
    1. Select the read + write settings you want - probably view only since it‚Äôs public!
    2. If you want to restrict who can access this shared folder, set a password
4. Click the ‚Äò**Copy to Clipboard**‚Äô üìã¬†button. The link will look something like this:
    1. [https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/8NffJ3rFyHaVjgR](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/8NffJ3rFyHaVjgR)

### Add the folder to your Renku project

1. Add a new data connector by clicking the ‚ûï¬†in the Data section of your project.
2. Click on Create a data connector and choose **Polybox** (or **SwitchDrive**)
3. At the bottom, select mode **Shared**.

4. Complete the information to your Shared folder:
    1. **Public link:** Paste the link to the folder.
    2. **Password:** If there is a password for the shared folder, enter that. Otherwise, leave it blank.

If the password is not provided, the folder will be empty.

    3. Click on **Test connection.**
    4. A message in green ‚ÄúThe connection to the storage works correctly.‚Äù should appear. Click on **Continue**.

5. Specify the final details of the data connector, namely:
    1. **Name**: term to refer to your data connector
    2. **Owner**: select where it belongs (either you as a user or a group)
    3. **Visibility**: decide whether it should be public or private
    4. **Mount point**: name of the directory in your session workspace where the folder will be mounted.
    5. **Read-only**: by default is active. Deactivate if you want to have read/write access.

        <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_blue.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_blue.svg" width="40px" /> If you need a folder to be read-only for some users and read+write for other users of the same project, you can create two public links with different rights and add the two connectors to the project. The read+write  should be protected with a password, which can be shared with those users who should access the folder with read+write rights. Therefore, only those users with the password will be able to modify the content of that folder through the appropriate connector.

    6. **Save credentials**: if there is a password for the folder, click this box if you want to save your password in RenkuLab. (Only you will have access to those credentials. Credentials are not shared in RenkuLab.)
