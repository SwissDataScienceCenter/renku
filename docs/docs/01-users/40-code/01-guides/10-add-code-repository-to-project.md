# How to add a code repository to your project

:::note

In order to access your code repository from RenkuLab, you need to connect your RenkuLab account with GitHub/GitLab. See [How to connect your Renku account to your GitHub or GitLab account](How%20to%20connect%20your%20Renku%20account%20to%20your%20GitHub%20o%203d394998d82b44b4a053e9461949119a.md).

In the project page:

1. Click on âž• in the Code Repositories section.

    Note that this should be the HTTP URL for your code repository, not the SSH url.

4. Click on **Add code repository** button
5. Check that the **access badge** indicates the access level you expect to have for this code repository. If you do not have the access you are expecting, see [How to connect your Renku account to your GitHub or GitLab account](How%20to%20connect%20your%20Renku%20account%20to%20your%20GitHub%20o%203d394998d82b44b4a053e9461949119a.md).
    
    :::note
    
    Once you have connected your accounts, your access to the code repository in RenkuLab will match your access level on GitHub/GitLab:
    
    - If you are able to write to the repository (push and pull rights) you will see a green status.
    - If you can only see the code repository, you will only be able to pull or clone from the code repository (status in yellow).
    - If you cannot access a given repository at all, your status will be in red.

:::info

Be mindful that your repository cannot be completely empty. Otherwise, you will not be able to launch the session in Renku! Create simply a `README.md` and it will be enough.
