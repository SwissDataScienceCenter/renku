## Running a course in Advanced Mode

If course participants need to be able to save their work during the course and they are comfortable using git, you can create a project (or a set of projects) for the course, and ask them to create a branch in the git repository where they can commit their changes.   

For creating the project:

1. Follow the steps in [Workshop Mode](https://www.notion.so/Workshop-Mode-1460df2efafc804e9fa9e3cebb8262ef?pvs=21) to set up the course project. 
2. Add the course participants to your Git code repository, so they can create their own branch.

    For example, if the course git repository is on GitHub, add the course participants to the repository **on GitHub**. When the student links their GitHub account with their Renku account, Renku will automatically reflect their access from GitHub.

3. Instruct course participants to connect their Renku account to their GitHub or GitLab account, as described in [How to connect your Renku account to your GitHub or GitLab account](How%20to%20connect%20your%20Renku%20account%20to%20your%20GitHub%20o%203d394998d82b44b4a053e9461949119a.md) 
4. Instruct course participants to work on their branch. Once they’ve launched a session, course participants can create a new branch with the following command:
    
    ```jsx
    git checkout -b my-branch-name
    ```
    
    You can read more in the [official git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout).
    
5. If you have introduce new material in the master branch, ask the course participants to rebase their branch to get those changes: 
    
    ```bash
    git checkout participant-branch
    git rebase master
    ```

❗

Be mindful to protect your code repository from undesired changes from participants via protected branches. You can find more information on this topic both for GitHub ([here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)) and GitLab ([here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/branches/protected.html)).
