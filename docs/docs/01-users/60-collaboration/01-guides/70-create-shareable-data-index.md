This tutorial will walk you through creating and sharing a dataset index on Renku to showcase the data outputs of your group.

1. First, create a group. The group page will be the base page for your dataset index.

2. Then, populate your page with data connectors. Set the data connectors’ visibility to public so that they are publicly visible. See our collection of How To Guides for options for creating data connectors.

    The above how-to guides instruct you to create a data connector in the context of a project. For this tutorial, instead create the data connectors on the group page directly by clicking the ➕ button in the **Data** section of the group page.
