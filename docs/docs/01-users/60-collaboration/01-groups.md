Renku offers two ways to collaborate as a group: together on a single project, or as a group working on multiple projects. 

## Collaborating on a single project

If your group is only working together on one project, we recommend to create a project and add all group members to that project.

## Collaborating on multiple projects

If you want to use Renku for your group and you will have multiple projects, we recommend creating a group. This will make it easier to manage who has access to a collection of projects and data connectors.
