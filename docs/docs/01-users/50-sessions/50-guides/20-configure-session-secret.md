# How to configure a session secret

Session secrets help you connect to protected resources, such as databases or external compute systems, from a Renku session in a standardized and shareable manner. Collaborating with secrets is easy too: configure a single session secret slot to ensure that the secret shows up the same way for everyone, and each person enters their own value.

## **How to add a session secret slot to the project**

The session secret **slot** determines how the secret shows up in the session (the secret file name and path), which is the same for every member of the project.

If you are adding a session secret to a project for the first time, follow these steps to set up the secret slot:

1. Go to project **Settings**.
2. Scroll down to the **Session secret slots** section.
3. Click the ➕ button to add a session secret slot.

5. Specify the **filename** for the secret slot.
6. Click **Add session secret slot** and continue to the next section…

You can either:

- **Provide a new secret value**: You can enter the for secret you want to use for the secret slot.
- **Use an existing secret value**: This lets you reuse a secret you have already saved in Renku for this secret slot.

    Tip: If you use the same database in multiple projects, you can save the database credential in Renku once, and use the *Use an existing secret value* option to attach that secret to multiple projects.
