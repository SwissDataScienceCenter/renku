Customizing sessions
====================

Very soon, you will want to make changes to the default configuration of your
interactive sessions. The default environments we provide are pretty bare-bones.
If you want to have easy access to your preferred packages, some simple steps
at the start of your project will get you on the way quickly.


Important files
---------------

The launch is enabled by the content in the following files in your project:

* ``Dockerfile``: defines the type of session and other software
  installed in the environment, including the ``renku`` command-line installation.

* ``.gitlab-ci.yml``: controls the docker build of the image based on the project's
  ``Dockerfile``.

* ``requirements.txt`` or ``install.R``: language-specific files controlling the
  libraries.

* ``.renku/renku.ini``: renku project configurations containing a
  ``[renku "interactive"]`` section.

The most basic modifications are installations of additional packages. This can be
done automatically for Python and R projects if you add the packages you want
to ``requirements.txt`` and ``install.R`` respectively.


.. _renku_project_config:

Renku project configurations
----------------------------

When starting a new Session, most of the options can be manually
changed by the user. Depending on the specific RenkuLab deployment, you can select
more RAM, more storage space, a higher CPU quota, etc.

Your project may even include a package with an advanced UI (like
`Streamlit <https://renku.discourse.group/t/how-to-deploy-streamlit-in-renku/169>`_)
and you probably want to choose it as default.

It's possible to set a default value for all these options, either using the
`renku config command`_ locally or in a session, or directly on RenkuLab project
page.

To do that, you can go into the project `Settings` section and click on the
`Sessions` tab. The interface shows the available project settings. Mind that you
can only select values valid to the specific RenkuLab instance. You can still use
the CLI to set any custom value, but that may not work as expected.

.. image:: ../../_static/images/project-session-settings.png
  :width: 85%

  :alt: Project session settings

If no default value is defined for a resource at the project level, the session
will likely use the default for the RenkuLab instance. Picking a specific value
is helpful if you know the project requires more resources than the standard.
Mind that users can always manually select different values when starting a
session if they want to, even if you set a default.

These configurations are stored in the  ``.renku/renku.ini`` file, so they are
preserved even if you move the project to another RenkuLab instance.

.. note::

  Sometimes you may want to add a non-default value, typically to select a custom
  default environment. You can use the `renku config command`_ from a session,
  for example:

  .. code-block:: bash

    renku config set interactive.default_url "/tree"

**What are the specific options?**

You can find a comprehensive list of options :ref:`on this page <renku_ini>`. Most
commonly, you may want to change the `Default Environment`, define the required resources,
or :ref:`pin a specific Docker image <pin_docker_image>` that your session will use.

The first case is useful when you prefer to show a different default UI, like the standard
Jupyter interface ``/tree``, or when you need support for a different interface,
like R studio ``/rstudio`` or  ``/streamlit`` (not included in the standard Python template).

The resources should be set when you know the lower values may not be enough for the project
requirements. The storage is particularly important since the session may not be able to
start without sufficient disk space. You should consider *not* fetching LFS data
automatically if those may fill up the disk space. 

The ``image`` is useful when you settle on a Docker image and you don't need to change it
anymore. The benefit is particularly evident when building a new image takes a lot of time
(e.g. you added big packages) or when you expect the project to be used by a lot of people
over a short period of time (e.g. you use it in a presentation or a lecture and you expect
the participants to fork the project).

.. warning::

  You need to :ref:`start a new session <session_start_new>` after any change to the project
  configuration since the changes are applied as a new commit. That does not affect any
  running session or any new session started from an older commit.

.. note::

  Mind that not all the RenkuLab instances have the same set of options or allow to choose
  the same values. If no GPUs are available, setting the default number to ``1`` can't work.
  Should this be the case, a warning will show before starting a new environment and on
  the project settings page.


Dockerfile structure
--------------------

The project's ``Dockerfile`` lives in the top level of the project directory. In
the default ``Dockerfile`` provided in the template, the first line is a
``RENKU_BASE_IMAGE`` argument used to feed the following ``FROM`` instruction.
It specifies a
`versioned base docker image <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renkulab-docker>`_.
We add new versions periodically, but the heart of it is the set of installations
of jupyterlab/rstudio, git, and renku::

  ARG RENKU_BASE_IMAGE=renku/renkulab-py:3.7-0.7.3

  # or, for RStudio

  ARG RENKU_BASE_IMAGE=renku/renkulab-r:4.0.0-0.7.3

The next two statements install user-specified libraries from ``environment.yml``
and ``requirements.txt``::

  # install the python dependencies
  COPY requirements.txt environment.yml /tmp/
  RUN conda env update -q -f /tmp/environment.yml && \
    /opt/conda/bin/pip install -r /tmp/requirements.txt && \
    conda clean -y --all && \
    conda env export -n "root"

Then we specify the renku version to be installed through ``pipx``::

  ARG RENKU_VERSION=0.12.1

You can add to this ``Dockerfile`` in any way you'd like.

.. _docker_dev:


Dockerfile development
----------------------

Before we get into modifying Dockerfiles, if you want to know how to update
the base version of your renkulab image, see `Upgrading Renku <upgrading_renku>`_.

If you're going to make simple modifications to the ``Dockerfile`` (i.e. changing
the base Docker image version number), you can use the following steps to update
and re-build the image:

#. On the project's landing page, click the **View in GitLab** button in the upper righthand corner (opens a new tab by default).
#. In GitLab, click the **Repository** tab in the lefthand column, which drops you into the **Files** tab.
#. Click the **Dockerfile** out of the list of files that appears, and click **Edit** (top right, near the red Delete button. Don't click the red Delete button.)
#. Make your edits in this window.
#. When you're satisfied with the edits, scroll down and write a meaningful **commit message** (you'll thank yourself later).
#. Click the green **Commit changes** button.

You may find the `official docker documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/>`_
useful during this process.

Now you have committed the changes to your ``Dockerfile``. Since you have made a commit,
the CI/CD pipeline will kick off (pre-configured for you as a ``renkulab-runner``
inside the GitLab CI/CD settings). It will attempt to rebuild your project with
the new contents of your ``Dockerfile`` based on the configuration in ``.gitlab-ci.yml``,
a file at the top level of your project directory.

The contents of ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` show you that in the build stage, we pull
the docker image for Renku, build our new image out of our ``Dockerfile``
with a tag relating to the commit, and push it.

Let's monitor this process:

#. Click the **CI/CD** > **Jobs** tab.
#. Click the latest status that corresponds to the changes to the ``Dockerfile`` you just made (probably "running", unless it's already "completed" or "failed").

This is the log file from the build process specified in the ``.gitlab-ci.yml``
file. If it succeeds, there will be a green **passed** status, and the end of
log will be a green **Job succeeded**. If the build instead failed, you can use
the messages in the log to determine why and hint at what you can do to fix it.

.. warning::

  Note that the settings have been configured for this build to time out and fail
  after one hour. While a long running build might be indicative of a bug in your
  ``Dockerfile``, it's possible that your build might take a long time. If this is the
  case, you can change the limits in the project settings via the lefthand column of the GitLab
  interface at **Settings** > **CI/CD** > **General pipelines** > **Timeout**.


Using your new Docker image
---------------------------

Passing CI/CD is great, but in order to use the new image you need to
start a new session.

To do this, go back to the Renku platform, and from the project's landing page,
first check in the **Files** tab that your changes to the ``Dockerfile`` are
present. If not, you can force-refresh the page. Then, go to the **Session** tab.
If you have any running sessions, those will keep running the
image built with the older version(s) of the ``Dockerfile``.
You can click on **New session** and **Start session** to start a new one that
includes the latest image.

.. _session_start_new:

.. note::

  By default, the **New session** page detects any running session and you may
  see the message `A session is already running.`, suggesting you open that
  one instead.

  .. image:: ../../_static/images/session-already-running.png
    :width: 85%
    :align: center
    :alt: A session is already running

  In this case, you can click on `Back to sessions list` and stop any running
  ones, or expand the `Advanced settings` section to select the commit.

  Be sure the list of commits has been refreshed and then select the latest
  one, which should appear as the first in the list.
  Beware that RenkuLab has an aggressive autosave system to prevent
  losing any unsaved work. Selecting the latest commit may show a warning if
  any unsaved work has been detected. If your latest commit already includes
  all the changes, you can safely ignore it.

If the server launches, test it to make sure that the extra functionality you
added in the ``Dockerfile`` is present in the container. If it is not, you can
go back to the GitLab interface and continue to make changes until you are
satisfied.

Looking to make more extensive modifications? Build running too long? Keep
on reading through the section below.


More extensive modifications
----------------------------

If you want to make more extensive modifications, say ones that would require
longer build times, you may wish to test the docker build on your own machine.
You can follow the `docker tutorial <https://docs.docker.com/get-started/>`_ to
get set up and learn how to build and test local images.

Once you have a local docker setup, you can clone your project locally (if you
haven't set up an SSH key from GitLab you'll need to do this), make
modifications to the ``Dockerfile``, and ``docker build`` and ``docker run`` to
test your changes. To test whether your docker image will work, try running it
with::

  docker run --rm -ti -p 8888:8888 <image> jupyter lab --ip=0.0.0.0

.. warning::

  You need to install ``jupyter`` and ``jupyterhub`` into the image to be able to
  start notebook servers on renkulab.io.

You can commit these changes and push to the repo. Then, follow the rest of the
steps in :ref:`docker_dev`.

Note that by default there are two choices for the ``Dockerfile`` (chosen at
project creation time via "python base" or "R base") for the base image, located
here:

* a `JupyterLab base <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-jupyter/tree/master/docker/base>`_ (with renku installed on top)
* a `rocker (R + RStudio) base <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-jupyter/tree/master/docker/r>`_ (with conda and renku installed on top)

These two images are available on `dockerhub <https://hub.docker.com/r/renku/>`_.

If you can't work with the template ``Dockerfile`` provided, you can pull one of
these base ``Dockerfile`` s and add the ``renku``, ``git``, and ``jupyter``
parts to another base image that you might have.
